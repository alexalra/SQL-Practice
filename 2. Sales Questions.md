What is the average duration of the tracks sold by the employee with higher sales?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>

300.456 EUR
```

Code

To answer this question I created 2 subquerries, that I merged at the end into 1 single table.

The first subquerry (TABLE_1) returned the employee with higher sales.
The second subquerry (TABLE_2) returned the average duration of the tracks sold by every employee.


```ruby
WITH TABLE_1 AS 

  (SELECT 
    E.FirstName NAME, 
    E.LastName LAST_NAME,
    SUM(I.total) TOTAL_SALES, 
    E.EmployeeId EMPLOYEE_ID 
  FROM 
    Invoice AS I
  JOIN 
    Customer as C
  ON 
    C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
  JOIN 
    Employee as E
  ON 
    C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId
  GROUP BY 
    4
  ORDER 
    BY 3 DESC
  LIMIT 
    1),

TABLE_2 AS 

  (SELECT 
    AVG(T.Milliseconds) AVERAGE_DURATION, 
    E.FirstName NAME,
    E.LastName LAST_NAME
  FROM 
    TRACK as T
  JOIN 
    InvoiceLine as IL 
  ON 
    T.TrackId = IL.TrackId
  JOIN 
    Invoice as I
  ON 
    IL.InvoiceId = I.InvoiceId
  JOIN 
    Customer as C
  ON 
    C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
  JOIN 
    Employee as E
  ON 
    C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId
  GROUP BY 
    2)

SELECT  
  TABLE_1.NAME, 
  TABLE_1.LAST_NAME,
  TABLE_2.AVERAGE_DURATION
FROM 
  TABLE_1
JOIN 
  TABLE_2
ON 
  TABLE_1.NAME = TABLE_2.NAME AND  
  TABLE_1.LAST_NAME =  TABLE_2.LAST_NAME
```
