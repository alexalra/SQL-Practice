## SQL-Practice - 1st project

This project will explore multiple questions with regard to the database Chinook.db, which represents a digital media store. 

The database was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marwandiab/chinookdatabase). 

The Entity Relation Diagram for the Database is available in the next file [README ERD.md](https://github.com/alexalra/SQL-Practice/blob/main/2.%20README%20ERD.md)

I explored the data in this database by asking questions related to the company's sales, HR-related or even about the use of data space. You can explore the following pages to see the questions I posed and the answered I obtained.
