## SQL-Practice - 1st project

This project will explore multiple questions with regard to the database Chinook.db, which represents a digital media store. The database was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marwandiab/chinookdatabase). 

I explored the data in this database by asking questions related to the company's sales or HR in order to showcast my SQL skills. You can explore the following pages to see the questions I posed and the answered I obtained.
