Let's create a table with information from the company's other partner stores. Namely, other digital media stores operating in the same field and with whom our company cooperates.

<details>

  <summary>1st Step - Create the table </summary>
  

```
Let's first create the table and define data types for every column. 
```
Code

```ruby

CREATE TABLE Partners_data (
    Partner_ID SERIAL NOT NULL,
    Name TEXT, 
    State TEXT,
    City TEXT,
    Number_Orders INTEGER,
    Start_Operations DATE NOT NULL, 
    PRIMARY KEY (Partner_ID));

```
</details>

<details>

  <summary>2nd Step - Let's fill up the table with information </summary>
  

```
Let's add rows with information to the already pre-establish columns according to the data type that each can bear. 
```
Code

```ruby

INSERT INTO Partners_data (name, State, City, Number_Orders, Start_Operations)
VALUES 
('Records_INC', 'Arizona', 'Yuma', 345, '1998-12-03')
('BestMusic', 'Denver', 'Colorado Springs', 567, '2002-02-23')
('TunesTX', 'Texas', 'Austin', 134, '2021-04-14')
('MyMusic', 'Columbia', 'Charleston', 789, '1986-01-13')
('ClassicSongs', 'Alabama', 'Montgomery', 409, '2007-12-03');

```
</details>


  <details>

  <summary>3rd Step - Alter the table </summary>

```
After sending the first version of the table to the Team, they informed that it had to be changed to reflect some data that was missing. Every partner stored is specialised in a music genre, which has to be reflected in the table.
```
Code

```ruby

```
