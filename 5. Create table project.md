Let's create a table with information from the company's other partner stores. Namely, other digital media stores operating in the same field and with whom our company cooperates.

  <summary>1st Step - Create the table </summary>
  

```
Let's first create the table and define data types for every column. 
```
Code

```ruby

CREATE TABLE Partners_data (
    Partner_ID SERIAL NOT NULL,
    Name TEXT, 
    State TEXT,
    City TEXT,
    Number_Orders INTEGER,
    Start_Operations DATE NOT NULL, 
    PRIMARY KEY (Partner_ID));

```
</details>

<details>

  <summary>2nd Step - Let's fill up the table with information </summary>
  

```
Let's add rows with information to the already pre-establish columns according to the data type that each can bear. 
```
Code

```ruby

INSERT INTO Partners_data (name, State, City, Number_Orders, Start_Operations)
VALUES 
('Records_INC', 'Arizona', 'Yuma', 345, '1998-12-03') 

```
</details>
