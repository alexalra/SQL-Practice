## HR Questions 

A new HR employee was recruited and is interested in knowing more about the company's employees. He is in charge of organising birthday parties and hire anniversaries, and needs to retrieve some data about it. He also wants to know about employees addresses to study potential home office arrangaments. Further, he has other HR related questions about hiring and reporting lines. He has sent the following questions.

4. Which different phone prefixes employees have?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
When I first tried to check the different prefixes, I noticed that not all of them where formated in the same way.

I tried substracting values to keep only the prefixes, but one of them was formated differently.

See the screenshot below. 
```
Code

```ruby

SELECT
  SUBSTR(phone,4, 4) AS PREFIX
FROM
  Employee

```

 <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
I made some changes in the code to take into account the uneven data.
I found that there are 2 different prefixes, 780 and 403.
```
Code

```ruby

SELECT
  SUBSTRING(phone,5, 3) AS VALUES_1
FROM
  Employee
WHERE
  phone LIKE '+1%';

SELECT
  SUBSTRING(phone,4, 3) AS VALUES_2
FROM
  Employee
WHERE
  phone LIKE '1%';


```
